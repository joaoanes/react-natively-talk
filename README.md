# React Natively
### A short presentation on React Native

Hello! 
In this short presentation, we go over what React Native is, where it came from, where it can be correctly used, and most important of all, what you can do with it, right now!

It consists of both the presentation slides, and the `freeplay` project.

## The slides

These use the `reveal.js` framework.

To start, simply `cd talk-slides` and `yarn && yarn start`, and a browser should pop right up with the presentation.
If it doesn't, contact your locally sourced, 100% organic and fair-trade system administrator. If those are good enough troubleshooting instructions for microsoft, they're good enough for me!

## The code
![Ding goes the bell!](/images/strongman.gif)
As part of the presentation, there's a live-code segment in which by using two npm packages, `react-native-interactable` and `react-native-sensors`, we build a sort-of [high striker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_striker) app, in which you must flick your wrist as hard as you can to reach a higher score.
To start, simply do `cd freecode`, `yarn` and `yarn ios`/`yarn android`, depending on your device/emulator setup. 


Let me know if there's any errors or anything that I said or wrote that you fundamentally disagree with. I'd be more than happy to accomodate your changes (if they're good!).
